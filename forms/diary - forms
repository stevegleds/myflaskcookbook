Added code to take user input to build url. I've successfully used this in timetrial project to build url for views but this fails

Created dropdown.py to pass colour list to index.html
index.html contains form that returns chosen colour to 'test' route
test route then checks if user selected red and renders red.html which contains a warning message. This shows that we can do something with the content
otherwise it simply returns page containing only the selected colour
